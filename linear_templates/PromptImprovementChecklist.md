# Prompt Improvement Checklist

Before using any prompt, ensure it has passed the following validations:

1. ✅ Clear Purpose
   - Is the intent specific and actionable?
   - Does it indicate input/output expectations?

2. ✅ Structured Format
   - Are there delimiters for variables?
   - Are instructions grouped logically?

3. ✅ Context-Aware
   - Does it reflect project goals or phase?
   - Does it include references to system context (e.g. `/docs`, `ai-config.json`)?

4. ✅ Quality-Optimized
   - Includes constraints (e.g., “output as JSON”, “no explanations”)
   - Tailored to agent skill level (e.g., DevAgent, DocGen, etc.)

5. ✅ Result-Validated
   - Has it been tested for output quality?
   - Are there examples of success or failure logs?

Once a prompt is validated, link it in the corresponding Linear task description.
